/* There are several ways to space flex items along the main axis. justify-content is one way to do that. justify-content: center; aligns all flex items to the center inside the flex container, flex-start aligns items to the start of the flex container. If it's a row it pushes items to the left, for columns it pushes them to the top of container. flex-end does the opposit of flex-start. space-between aligns items to the center of the main axis with space between the flex items. flex-around is similar to space-between, but first and last item are not at the edges of the container, all items have space around them. */
