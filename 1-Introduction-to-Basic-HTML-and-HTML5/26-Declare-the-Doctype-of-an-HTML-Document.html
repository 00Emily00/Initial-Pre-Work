<!--At the top of each HTML document you must specify which version of HTML your page is using. Most browsers support HTML5, but older web pages use previous version language. So the ! in <!DOCTYPE html> is super important for older browsers.-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
</html>
