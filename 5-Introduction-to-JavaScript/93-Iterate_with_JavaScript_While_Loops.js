// iterating means to run the same code multilple times. There are many ways to do this. The hile loop will run code while a specific condition is true and stops once a condition is not true.

// Setup
var myArray = [];

// Only change code below this line.
var i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    myArray.push(i);
    i++;
}
