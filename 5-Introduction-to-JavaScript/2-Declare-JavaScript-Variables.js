// I learned that data is anything that is meaningful to the computer. The 7 different data types are: undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, number, and object. Variables are used to store data instead of using the data directly. Variables are like a box where you store all your information in

// Example
var ourName;

// Declare myName below this line
var myName;
