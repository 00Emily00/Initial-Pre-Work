// There is something we call array variables, we can store different pieces of data in one variable. To create an array variable you have opening and closing brackets. Inside the brackets you separate each entry with a comma

// Example
var ourArray = ["John", 23];

// Only change code below this line.
var myArray = ["Happy", 50];
