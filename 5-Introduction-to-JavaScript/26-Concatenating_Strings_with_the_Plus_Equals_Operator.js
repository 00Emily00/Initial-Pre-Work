// You can also use the += operator to concatenate a string to an existing string variable. Use += the way it was used with number variables

// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. ";
ourStr += "I come second.";

// Only change code below this line

var myStr = "This is the first sentence. ";
myStr += "This is the second sentence.";
