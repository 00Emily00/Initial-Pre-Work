// a string is defined by the start and end of " or ' quotes. But if you literally need to add " or ' inside your string you have to put a \ before putting the opening quote and you need another \ and your ending quote right after it.

var myStr = "I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\"."; // Change this line
