// String values cannot be altered once created. They are immutable. characters can't be changed, only strings can. You can't say that you want to change the first letter [0] of a string, you can only assign that variable to a different string.

// Setup
var myStr = "Jello World";

// Only change code below this line

myStr = "Hello World"; // Fix Me
