// multi-dimensional array is simply array inside arrays. You can use multiple brackets to access the arrays. The first brackets refer to the entries in the outer-most array, and the next bracket referes to the second outer-most array and so on.

// Setup
var myArray = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9], [[10,11,12], 13, 14]];

// Only change code below this line.
var myData = myArray[2][1];
