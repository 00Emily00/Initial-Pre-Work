// single and double quotes work the same in JavaScript. You just need to end and start with the same kind. But if you need to use " or ' as part of your string, you have to use \. If you wrap the whole string with ', you don't need \ for the double quotes inside the string.

var myStr = '<a href="http://www.example.com" target="_blank">Link</a>';
