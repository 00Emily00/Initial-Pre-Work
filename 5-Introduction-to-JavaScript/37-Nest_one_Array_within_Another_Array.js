// I also learned that you can nest (put one inside of another) arrays within other arrays, with multiple brackets. You have one big bracket and then you can have more brackets inside of it. This is called Multi-dimensional Array

// Example
var ourArray = [["the universe", 42], ["everything", 101010]];

// Only change code below this line.
var myArray = [["Hello" + 23], "World"];
