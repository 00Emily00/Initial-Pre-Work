// I learned that variables in JavaScript are case sensitive (there is a difference between myvar and Myvar). The best practice to write variables is camelCase (letter of first word is lower case, but first word of second, third etc. word has an uppercase on the first letter.)

// Declarations
var studlyCapVar;
var properCamelCase;
var titleCaseOver;

// Assignments
studlyCapVar = 10;
properCamelCase = "A String";
titleCaseOver = 9000;
