// I learned that objects are similar to arrays, but instead of indexes to access and modify their data, you access the data in objects through something called properties. (example: JSON objects)

// Example
var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};

// Only change code below this line.

var myDog = {
  "name": "Indie",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["Jon Michael", "Claudia", "Emily"]
  
  
  
};
