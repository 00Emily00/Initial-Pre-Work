// We can access data inside arrays by using indexes. Indexes are written the same way as bracket notations. So you write it exactly the same when trying to access bracket notation. Array name and square brackets shouldn't have any spaces in between (even though JS can understand this, but other programmers might get confused)

// Example
var ourArray = [50,60,70];
var ourData = ourArray[0]; // equals 50

// Setup
var myArray = [50,60,70];

// Only change code below this line.
var myData = myArray[0];
