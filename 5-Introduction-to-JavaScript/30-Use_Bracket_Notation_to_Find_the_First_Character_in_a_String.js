// Bracket notation ([]) is a way to get a specific character from the string. Programming languages start counting at 0. So 0 is the first character in a string.

// Example
var firstLetterOfFirstName = "";
var firstName = "Ada";

firstLetterOfFirstName = firstName[0];

// Setup
var firstLetterOfLastName = "";
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
firstLetterOfLastName = lastName[0];
